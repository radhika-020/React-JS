1) JSX :-
  a) JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is used with React to describe what the User Interface should look like.
  b) By using JSX, you can write HTML structures in the same file that contains JavaScript code.
  c) JsX helps in making the code easier to understand and debug as it avoids usage of JS DOM structures which are rather complex.


2) Virtual DOM :-
  a) React keeps a lightweight representation of the Real DOM in the memory, and that is known as the VIrtual DOM.
  b) Manipulating Real DOM is much slower than manipulating virtual DOM, because nothing gets drawn onscreen.
  c) When the state of an object changes, Virtual DOM changes only that object in the Real DOM instead of updating all the objects.
  
  
3) React Extensions :-
  a) React goes beyond simple UI and has many extensions for complete application architecture support.
  b) It provides server-side rendering.
  c) Supports mobile app development.
  d) Extended with Flux and Redux, among others.
  Some of the extensions that can be mentioned here are :-
    i) Flux :- It is the application architecture that Facebook uses for building web applications.
    ii) React Native :- It lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript.
    
    
4) Event in React :-
  a) An event is an action that can be triggered by a User or any System event like pressing a key, a mouse click, etc.
  b) It can be created as follows :-
  create Simple extends React.Component {
    work() {
      alert("Good work!");
   }
   render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.work}>Do some work!</button>
    );
   }
  }
